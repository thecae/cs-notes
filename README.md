# CS Notes

These are the notes that I have compiled in my journey to learn all that I can about computer science.  This notes database will get larger and larger with the more classes that I take.

The notes are organized into various subjects that I have started working on.  Some of these are courses that I took in school and others are notes that I self-taught.  Some courses are combined and appended into larger folders for ease of access.

Some of the larger subjects depend on the knowledge and basis of a programming languages.  For example, *data structures* is written entirely in C++.

Below is a hierarchial list of the subjects covered:
* Algorithms (*in progress*)
