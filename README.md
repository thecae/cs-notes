# Welcome!

These are the notes that I have compiled in my journey to learn all that I can about computer science. This notes database will get larger and larger with the more classes I take.

The notes are organized into various subjects that I have started working on. Some of these are courses I took in school, and others are notes in self-taught subjects. Some courses are combined and appended into larger folders for ease of access.

Some of the larger subjects depend on the knowledge and basis of programming languages. For example, _data structures_ are written entirely in C++.

Below is a hierarchical list of the subjects covered:

* [Algorithms](the-notes/Algorithms/)
* [Data Structures](the-notes/DataStructures/)
* [Hack Protection](the-notes/HackProtection/)
* [Programming Languages](the-notes/ProgrammingLanguages/)
