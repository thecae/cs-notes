# SQL

Structured Query Language, or SQL, is a programming language dedicated to creating and managing databases. There are many different domains that handle SQL, each having slight differences in how commands are executed and the names of commands. The ones most commonly used in these notes are MySQL and Microsoft SQLServer. SQL is in charge of data located inside a Database Management System (DBMS) or Relational DBMS (RDBMS).

SQL is widely popular because it offers the following advantages:
* Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.
* Allows users to describe the data.
* Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.
* Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.
* Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.
* Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.
* Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.

The topics on Integration of SQL with other languages are as follows:
* Integrating SQL into C++
* Integrating SQL into Java
* Integrating SQL into Python

No knowledge of SQL is needed for the lessons on SQL. Knowledge of SQL and the respective programming language is needed for the integrations.
