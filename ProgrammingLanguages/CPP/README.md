# C++

C++ is a general purpose, middle-level, object-oriented, statically-typed programming language that has a variety of uses and is known for its extremely fast compilation and execution speeds. It offers a bridge between high-level programming seen in similar languages as well as low-level features that cause its extremely fast compilation speed.
