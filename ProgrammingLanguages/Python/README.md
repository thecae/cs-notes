# Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, object-oriented, dynamically-typed programming language that has a variety of uses. Python was developed to be simple to use and as easy to understand as regular English, allowing for short development times and ease of understanding. Python is an open-source language developed entirely by one person and then evolved by the community.

Python is useful for:
* Web and Internet development (Django and Pyramid frameworks, Flask and Bottle micro-frameworks)
* Scientific and Numeric Computing (Scipy, Numpy, and Matplotlib packages)
* Desktop GUIs (Qt, Kivy, wxWidgets)
* Software Development (Buildbot, Trac, Roundup)
* Games (Battlefield, Civilization IV)
* Websites and Services (Dropbox, Uber)

The list of topics are covered below:
1. [Intro to Python](/ProgrammingLanguages/Python/01_IntroToPython.md)
2. [Variables and Expressions](/ProgrammingLanguages/Python/02_VariablesAndExpressions.md)
3. [Functions](/ProgrammingLanguages/Python/03_Functions.md)
4. [String Basics](/ProgrammingLanguages/Python/04_StringBasics.md)

Below are some applications of Python that extend beyond basic programming:
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib

Below are some APIs that use Python:
* Discord API
* Airtable API

The lessons on how Python works require no knowledge of Python; however, knowledge of Python is required for the lessons on frameworks and packages.
