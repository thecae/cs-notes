A ***derived class*** (or ***subclass***) is a class that is derived from another class.  The ***base class*** (or ***superclass***) is the generic class that the derived class is based from.

***Inheritance*** is the concept that the derived class inherits properties from the base class.
```c++
// Base class
class GenericItem {
   public:
      void SetName(std::string newName) { 
          itemName = newName; 
      }
   
      void SetQuantity(int newQty) {
          itemQuantity = newQty; 
      }
   
      void PrintItem() {
          std::cout << itemName << " " << itemQuantity << endl;
      }
   
   private:
      std::string itemName;
      int itemQuantity;
};

// Derived class inherits from GenericItem 
class ProduceItem : public GenericItem { 
   public:
      void SetExpiration(std::string newDate) { 
          expirationDate = newDate; 
      }
   
      std::string GetExpiration() { 
          return expirationDate; 
      }
   
   private:
      std::string expirationDate;
};
```

Below are some inheritance variations:

- A derived class can serve as a base class for another class. Ex: `class FruitItem: public ProduceItem {...}` creates a derived class `FruitItem` from `ProduceItem`, which was derived from `GenericItem`.
- A class can serve as a base class for multiple derived classes. Ex: `class FrozenFoodItem: public GenericItem {...}` creates a derived class FrozenFoodItem that inherits from `GenericItem`, just as `ProduceItem` inherits from `GenericItem`.
- A class may be derived from multiple classes. Ex: `class House: public Dwelling, public Property {...}` creates a derived class House that inherits from base classes `Dwelling` and `Property`.

## Member Access
The members of a derived class have access to the public members of the base class, but not to the private members of the base class. This is logicalâ€”allowing access to all private members of a class merely by creating a derived class would circumvent the idea of private members. Thus, adding the following member function to the Restaurant class yields a compiler error.

A third access specifier is ***protected***, which provides access to derived classes but not by anyone else. The following illustrates the implications of the protected access specifier.
```c++
class Business {   
   protected: // Members accessible by self and derived classes
      std::string name;
   
   private:   // Members accessible only by self
      std::string address;

   public:    // Members accessible by anyone
      void PrintMembers();
};

class Restaurant : public Business {
   private:
      int rating;

   public:

      /* ... */

      void DisplayRestaurant() {
         // Attempted accesses
         PrintMembers();             // OK
         name = "Gyro Hero";         // OK    ("protected" above made this possible)
         address = "5 Fifth St";     // ERROR
      }

      // Other class members ...

};

int main() {
   /* ... */
   
   Business business;
   Restaurant restaurant;
   
   /* ... */
   
   // Attempted accesses
   business.PrintMembers();          // OK
   business.name  = "Gyro Hero";     // ERROR (protected only applies to derived classes)
   business.address = "5 Fifth St";  // ERROR
   
   restaurant.PrintMembers();         // OK
   restaurant.name  = "Gyro Hero";    // ERROR
   restaurant.rating = 5;  // ERROR
   
   return 0;
}
```

To summarize the type of specifiers, consult the below table.

| Specifier | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `private` | Accessible by self |
| `protected` | Accessible by self and derived classes |
| `public` | Accessible by self, derived classes, and everyone else |

Separately, the keyword "public" in a class definition like `class DerivedClass: public BaseClass {...}` has a different purpose, relating to the kind of inheritance being carried out:

- `public` : "`public->public, protected->protected`" -- public members of `BaseClass` are accessible as public members of DerivedClass, and protected members of `BaseClass` are accessible as protected members of `DerivedClass`.
- `protected` : "`public->protected, protected->protected`" -- public and protected members of BaseClass are accessible as protected members of `DerivedClass`.
- `private` : "`public->private, protected->private`" -- public and protected members of BaseClass are accessible as private members of `DerivedClass`. Incidentally, if the specifier is omitted as in "`class DerivedClass: BaseClass {...}`", the default is private.

## Overriding Member Functions
When a derived class defines a member function that has the same name and parameters as a base class's function, the member function is said to ***override*** the base class's function.
```c++
class Business {
   public:
      ...
      std::string GetDescription() const {
         return name + " -- " + address;
      }

   protected:
      std::string name;
      std::string address;
};

class Restaurant : public Business {
   public:
      ...
      std::string GetDescription() const { // overrides above GetDescription function
         return name + " -- " + address + 
            "\n  Rating: " + std::to_string(rating);
      }

   private:
      int rating;
};

int main() {
   Restaurant favoritePlace;
   favoritePlace.SetName("Friends Cafe");
   favoritePlace.SetAddress("500 W 2nd Ave");
   favoritePlace.SetRating(5);
   std::cout << favoritePlace.GetDescription() << endl;

   return 0;
}
```

An overriding function can call the overridden function by prepending the base class name.
```c++
class Restaurant : public Business {

   /* ... */

   std::string GetDescription() const {
      return Business::GetDescription() + "\n  Rating: " + std::to_string(rating);
   };

   /* ... */
};
```

# Polymorphism and Virtual Member Functions
***Polymorphism*** refers to determining which program ehavior to execute depending on the data type.  There are two types:

- ***Compile-time polymorphism*** is when the compiler determines which function to call at compile-time.
- ***Runtime polymorphism*** is when the compiler is unable to determine which function to call at compile-time, so the determination is made while the program is running.

```c++
// Compile-Time Polymorphism
void DriveTo(std::string restaurant) {
   std::cout << "Driving to " << restaurant << endl;
}

void DriveTo(Restaurant restaurant) {
   std::cout << "Driving to " << restaurant.GetDescription() << endl;
}

int main() {
   DriveTo("Big Mac's");  // Call string version
}
```
```c++
// Runtime Polymorphism
void DriveTo(Business* businessPtr) {
   std::cout << "Driving to " << businessPtr->GetDescription() << endl;
}

int main() {
   int index;
   std::vector<Business*> businessList;
   Business* businessPtr;
   Restaurant* restaurantPtr;
   
	/* ... */
   
   businessList.push_back(businessPtr);
   businessList.push_back(restaurantPtr);

   index = rand() % businessList.size();
   DriveTo(businessList.at(index));
}
```

The program above uses a C++ feature called ***derived/base class pointer conversion***, where a pointer to a derived class is converted to a pointer to the base class without explicit casting. 

A ***virtual function*** is a member function that may be overriden in a derived class and is used for runtime polymorphism.  The ***override*** keyword is an optional keyword to indicate that a virtual function is overridden in a derived class.
```c++
class Business {
public:
   std::string GetDescription() const {
      return name + " -- " + address;
   }
   ...
};

class Restaurant : public Business {
public:
   std::string GetDescription() const {
      return name + " -- " + address +
         "\n  Rating: " + std::to_string(rating);
   }
   ...
};

int main() {
   Business* businessPtr;
   Restaurant favoriteCafe;
   favoriteCafe.SetName("Friends Cafe");
   favoriteCafe.SetAddress("500 2nd Ave");
   favoriteCafe.SetRating(5);

   // Point to favoriteCafe
   businessPtr = &favoriteCafe;

   std::cout << businessPtr->GetDescription();
}
```

A ***pure virtual function*** is a virtual function that has no definition in the base class, and all derived classes must override the function.  It is declared with a virtual function and is assigned to zero.  A class with at least one pure virtual function is known as an ***abstract base class***.
```c++
class Business {
public:
   void SetName(std::string busName) {
      name = busName;
   }

   void SetAddress(std::string busAddress) {
      address = busAddress;
   }

   virtual std::string GetDescription() const {
      return name + " -- " + address;
   }

   virtual std::string GetHours() const = 0;     // pure virtual function

protected:
   std::string name;
   std::string address;
};
```

## Abstract Classes
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful programming technique consisting of three main features:

- ***Classes***: Encapsulates data and behavior into objects
- ***Inheritance***: Allows one class to be based on another
- ***Abstract class***: A class that guides the design of subclasses but does not function as a standalone object

To summarize:

- A ***pure virtual function*** is a virtual function that is not implemented in the base class, thus all derived classes must override the function.
- An ***abstract class*** is a class that cannot be instantiated as an object, but is the superclass for a subclass and specifies how the subclass must be implemented. Any class with one or more pure virtual functions is abstract.
- A ***concrete class*** is a class that is not abstract, and hence can be instantiated.

## Is-a Vs. Has-a
***Composition*** (a has-a relationship) is the idea that one object may be made up of other objects.  This does not involve inheritance.
```c++
class ChildInfo {
   string firstName;
   string birthDate;
   string schoolName;

   /* ... */
};

class MotherInfo { // a mother HAS a child
   string firstname;
   string birthDate;
   string spouseName;
   vector<ChildInfo> childrenData;

   /* ... */
};
```

***Inheritance*** (a is-a relationship) where a class is made up of other classes' objects.
```c++
class PersonInfo {
   string firstName;
   string birthDate;

   /* ... */
};

class ChildInfo : public PersonInfo { // a child IS A person
   string schoolName;

   /* ... */
};

class MotherInfo : public PersonInfo {
   string spouseName;
   vector<ChildInfo> childrenData;

   /* ... */
};
```

Programmers commonly draw class inheritance relationships using ***Unified Modeling Language (UML)***.  UML a language for software design that uses different types of diagrams to visualize the structure and behavior of programs. A ***structural diagram*** visualizes static elements of software, such as the variables and functions used in the program. A ***behavioral diagram*** visualizes dynamic behavior of software, such as the flow of an algorithm.

A UML ***class diagram*** is a structural diagram that can be used to visually model the classes of a computer program, including member variables and functions.

- `-`: Private Variable
- `+`: Public Variable
- `->`: Identifies one class inherits from another
- *Italics*: Denotes abstract classes
