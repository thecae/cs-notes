# Discrete Structures & Algorithms

Discrete Structures contains a broad survey of mathematical tools including logic and reasoning, proof-writing, functions and relations, algorithmic analysis, basic counting and probability, and elementary data structures. The tools contained in this course are essential for an understanding of computer science. The purpose of discrete structures is to utilize logic and critical thinking to determine the most efficient method to solve a problem, the analysis and proofs behind time and space complexities, and a bridge between mathematics and computer science.
