# Programming Languages

Programming languages are the backbone of computer science. They are the basis that computer scientists execute functions and accomplish tasks. Different programming languages have different capabilities and are better suited for different tasks, so knowing a variety of languages is very beneficial for being an experienced programmer.

The languages covered in this subject area are:

* [C#](../../ProgrammingLanguages/C/#/README.md)
* [C++](CPP/)
* [Java](../../ProgrammingLanguages/Java/)

Most languages require no other language experience to get started; however, CSS does expect some knowledge of HTML to understand how it is useful and its application.
